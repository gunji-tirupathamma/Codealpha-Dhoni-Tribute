        <div class="text-container">
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <hr width="100%" color="black" />
            <p>Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family to parents from Uttarakhand. He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand. His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi. Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname "Dhauni".
                <br/>
                Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team, but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.
                <br/>
                "From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal."

            <h3>Early Career</h3>
            <hr width="100%" color="black" />
            <p>Dhoni's entry into competitive cricket was facilitated by Deval Sahay, a prominent figure in the Bihar Cricket Association. He joined the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team in 1998 and quickly made an impact by excelling in his batting position. Dhoni's outstanding performance for CCL led to his selection in the Bihar junior team, followed by the senior Bihar Ranji Team within a year. In the 1998–99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni represented the U-19 Bihar team and scored 176 runs in 5 matches. Despite a strong performance, Bihar finished fourth in the group.
                Dhoni made his debut in the Ranji Trophy for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season at the age of eighteen. He marked his debut with an impressive half-century against the Assam cricket team. Dhoni's first-class century came in the 2000/01 season, solidifying his position in the Bihar team.
                In the 2002–03 season, Dhoni's batting style and lower-order contributions began gaining recognition. Dhoni's inclusion in the East Zone squad for the Duleep Trophy finals showcased his emerging talent. Dhoni's talent was spotted through the BCCI's talent-spotting initiative, TRDW, by Prakash Poddar, former Bengal captain.
                Dhoni's exceptional performances in the 2003/04 season led to his selection in the India A squad for tours of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Notable performances include a standout wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings against Zimbabwe XI. Dhoni's instrumental role in helping India A chase down a target of 223 against Pakistan A demonstrated his prowess in pressure situations. Dhoni's consistent and outstanding performances caught the attention of senior players like Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri.
